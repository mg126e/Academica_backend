# Reflection

## What was hard or easy?
- Looking at this project in a binary way, I would classify it as hard. Developing a full stack project was challenging and taught me to work with many new technologies (Mongo, Render, Vue, etc.).

## What mistakes did you make, and how would you avoid making them in the future?
- The biggest mistake I made was using agentic coding and the context tool when I was not completely sure of the output I was looking for. It led to an overhaul of how I built "courses" and "sections" at the beginning of my project. Through working on this project, I have become more proficient at prompting LLMs.

## What skills did you acquire, and which do you feel you still need to develop further?
- In the next project I want to further develop my UI and UX design skills. I enjoyed the process of creating the design of my website and hope I can approach it more systematically in the future.
- I feel that I still have to work on my backend skills, I struggled to work with Render and Mongo and still struggle to understand how all the parts of my project connect.

## How did you use the Context tool?
- I used the context tool most when I was creating my concepts and testing files. It was extremely useful as most other LLMs do not have a solid understanding of concept design in the way it was taught in class. However, I did value the tool's introduction later in the course. It helped me understand concept design on my own first before interacting with Context. This also means I had a solid idea of what I expected from the Context tool when I was transitioning my concepts from specs to code letting me prompt Context efficiently and specifically.

## How did you use an agentic coding tool?
- I relied on agentic coding to bridge the gap between my understanding of the new technologies we were working with and the website I wanted to create. I felt most comfortable prompting agentic tools when I was building my front end because I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and could manually fine toon features after an LLM created the general framework.

## What conclusions would you draw about the appropriate role of LLMs in software development?
- In my opinion I believe LLMs are useful in the same way google is use for software development. I often confuse simple functions in Java, JavaScript, and Python (e.g., turning a string into an integer) and I find google and its Ai summarization at the top of the page very helpful to refresh my memory. I think LLMs should serve a similar role and create general frameworks and supply general knowledge that human developers fill in and elaborate on.
